h2. Running

From the root dir of the program, running @$ rake -T@ will give you a list of runnable tasks.  Output numbers match with the desired output numbering scheme listed online.

For completeness, here is a listing of the commands:

bc. rake output_1    # Sort by gender (females > males) then by LN ASC
rake output_2    # Sort by DOB ASC
rake output_3    # Sort by LN DESC
rake test_units  # Run tests for test_units

h2. Comments

No yaml files are used since its assumed the location of the input files wont change.  Besides, its sort of overkill to create a config file for the options available for this task, in my humble opinion.  Also, rdocs are included just for completeness and to save the end-user the time of generating them.

h2. Versions

bc. ruby -v: ruby 1.8.7 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 72) [universal-darwin10.0]
rake --version: rake, version 0.8.3

h2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Write a Ruby program to first assemble a single set of records by parsing data from 3 different file formats and then display these records sorted in 3 different ways.

h3. Details

h4. The Data

A record consists of the following 5 fields: last name, first name, gender, date of birth and favorite color. You will be given 3 files, each containing records stored in a different format.

The pipe-delimited file lists each record as follows: 
@LastName | FirstName | MiddleInitial | Gender | FavoriteColor | DateOfBirth@

The comma-delimited file looks like this: 
@LastName, FirstName, Gender, FavoriteColor, DateOfBirth@

And lastly, the space-delimited file: 
@LastName FirstName MiddleInitial Gender DateOfBirth FavoriteColor@

You may assume that the delimiters (commas, pipes and spaces) do not appear anywhere in the data values themselves. Write a Ruby program to read in records from these files and combine them into a single set of records.

h4. Display Requirements

Create and display 3 different views of the recordset (see a sample here):
* Output 1 – sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending.
* Output 2 – sorted by birth date, ascending.
* Output 3 – sorted by last name, descending.

Ensure that fields are displayed in the following order: @last name, first name, gender, date of birth, favorite color.@
Display dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
