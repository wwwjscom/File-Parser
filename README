-- Running -- 
From the root dir of the program, running
$ rake -T
will give you a list of runnable tasks.  Output numbers match with the desired output numbering scheme listed online.

For completeness, here is a listing of the commands:
rake output_1    # Sort by gender (females > males) then by LN ASC
rake output_2    # Sort by DOB ASC
rake output_3    # Sort by LN DESC
rake test_units  # Run tests for test_units

-- COMMENTS --
No yaml files are used since its assumed the location of the input files wont change.  Besides, its sort of overkill to create a config file for the options available for this task, in my humble opinion.
Also, rdocs are included just for completeness and to save the end-user the time of generating them.
